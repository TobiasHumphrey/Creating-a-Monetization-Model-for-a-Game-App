# Creating-a-Monetization-Model-for-a-Game-App
In this project, I analyzed user activity on the "Space Brothers" gaming app to provide recommendations which will help the app developers as they create a monetization model for the app.

This project presented some fun challenges. I was not provided detailed information on how the gaming app worked, so I used EDA to get a better understanding of how the game worked based on events included in the user data and how different routes for game competition related to the target values.

Regarding target values, the only information provided was that in-game ads were to be displayed where users selected the type of structure to build in the game. As such, I explored frequency of “building” events as well as how many days users spent on the game app. I used my findings to separate the users into groups which performed better or worse. I tested and confirmed the statistical significance of differences in performance between the various user groups.

In the end, the most important factor was cost per user (based on four advertisement sources used to obtain new users). I explored differences in user performance between each source as well, but the source did not have much effect on user activity.
